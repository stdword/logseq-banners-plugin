    * `banner:: false`

* All customizations (a lot!) can be done from plugin settings ("Settings -> Plugin Settings -> Banners") in nice grouped blocks:
* Example for advanced settings (JSON) for custom page types: "Settings -> Plugin Settings -> Banners -> Advanced settings -> Advanced custom pages banners and icons config -> Edit settings.json"
